										“Es mundus excrementi filii canes!” you shout to the four students pinning you down as you struggle to get up. (loosely translated “You’re a pile of excrement, you sons of dogs!”
										Although dogs isn’t too gender-specific and excrement not too offensive either, the intended meaning carries a much more negative connotation.) <br>
										The whole class is taken aback, though recovers quite quickly to this show of your attitude. You seize your opportunity and get up, ready to fight anyone who dared to get in your way. <br>
										“Bovus sturcus deodamnatus!” (literally, “Bull ****, damnit!”) Mr. Arduum shouts, as he snatches the cane from your friend and grabs you by the neck with one hand and swings the cane with his other hand. <br>
										<strong> WHACK!</strong> <br>
										You fight back tears as the cane lands on your rear end. It was just a ¼-inch-thick wooden stick wrapped with thorned vines, but it was exceptionally painful for whatever reason today.
										Maybe they used a different type of vine? You think mockingly as the cane lands again, this time on your bare back… three more to go, you think to yourself as warm blood trickles down your backside onto the floor…

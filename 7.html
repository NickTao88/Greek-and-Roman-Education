                    “Ahem! Class, now that you have gotten your essays back, you can see the errors you have made. I want you to write 100 words on why you did what you did wrong on this assignment. To be handed in tomorrow.” <br>
                    (In reality, assessments in schools were conducted and graded on-the-spot. There was no such thing as homework.) <br>
                    “Mr. Arduum, what if I managed to get a perfect score?” You ask, being as arrogant yet factual as usual and not much concerned about the consequences, although you knew very well what they might be. <br>
                    Then again, you don’t have anymore strength to beat me up again, do you, Servus Decremento Arduum? You taunt Mr. Arduum in your heart.
                    (The nickname Tiberius uses here translates roughly to “slave [who is] decreasing [in status yet constantly] difficult”, hinting Tiberius’ displeasure at the insignificance of Mr. Arduum despite him being Tiberius’ teacher.) <br>

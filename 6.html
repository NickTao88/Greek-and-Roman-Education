                    “Mr. Arduum, it is the duty of a good shepherd to shear his sheep, not skin them.’” you say, hoping this would get you out of a beating. <br>
                    (Tiberius actually said this during his reign, when elicited by governors to increase taxes.) <br>
                    “Have you any idea what shearing means? It means to quite literally break the structure of or remove something. You’re lucky I haven’t yet broken the structure of or removed any of your bones!
                    For saying this, you get three strokes of the cane. Now bend over!” <br>
                    Mr. Arduum rebukes you for your insolence as he reaches for the cane and motions for your friend (which Mr. Arduum knows nothing about) to come up and beat you.
                    Four students get up and pin you down on the floor.

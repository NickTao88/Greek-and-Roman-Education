										“Mr. Arduum, you’re late to class! You were supposed to be here half an hour ago!” <br>
										You yell down the courtyard. Mr. Arduum wheels around and points at you sternly, shouting, <br>
										“THOU SHALT NOT PASS!” (This is just Mr. Arduum’s way of telling people to stop right there…) <br>
										“Mister…” Mr. Arduum began, only to falter in calling you by name. <br>
										“Tiberius… sir,” you answer hopefully, preferred to be called by your first name. <br>
										“Right… you insolent son of the devil. You were supposed to be here 45 minutes ago! Remember the class rules?” <br>
										Mr. Arduum continues, ignoring your helpful remark. “As such, by the rules, you will receive 5 strokes of the cane. Now hurry up and enter the classroom, or it will be 39.” <br>
										Mr. Arduum walks off with his head held high as you follow behind trudgingly. (39 strokes of the cane was the maximum punishment allowed under Imperial law.)

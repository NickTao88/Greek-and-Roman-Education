										“Don’t you dare move, or else…”, one of the four holding you down says as your friend raises the cane. <br>
										You close your eyes, accepting your grim fate and waiting for your blood to start trickling off your backside and onto the floor. <br>
										<strong> WHACK! </strong> <br>
										There was the cane, but there was no pain. Instead, you hear a deep and hoarse groan despite it being almost inaudible. “ES STURCUS!” Mr. Arduum shouts in a hoarse voice again. (literally, “you excrement!”)
										Apparently, your friend “missed” and hit Mr. Arduum in the shins instead. <br>
										“I will not suffer this nonsense!” Mr. Arduum shouts as soon as he recovers from the blow. <br>
										Mr. Arduum grabs the cane from your friend and grabs you by the neck with one hand and swings the cane with his other hand. <br>
										<strong> WHACK! </strong> <br>
										You fight back tears as the cane lands on your rear end.
										It was just a ¼-inch-thick wooden stick wrapped with thorned vines, but it was exceptionally painful for whatever reason today.
										Maybe they used a different type of vine? Maybe the weather is colder than usual? You think mockingly as the cane lands again, this time on your bare back…
										just a few more to go, you think to yourself as you feel your own warm blood trickle down your backside onto the floor…

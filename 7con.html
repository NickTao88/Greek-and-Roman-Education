                    “You will never be perfect…  Mr. Nero.” Mr. Arduum sneers at you. (Tiberius’ last name was Nero.) <br>
                    “So, I suggest you start figuring out where you went wrong and why. I only gave you this high mark because your father did not want to you to bring disgrace to your name for your future’s sake.” <br>
                    You glower at this snide remark that Mr. Arduum just made, yet looking down at your paper with red circles all over it, you instantly felt that there might have been a small bit of truth to that remark. <br>
                    “Now, who can tell me who wrote Carpe Diem? Specifically, in which book can you find this poem? Mr. Nero?” Mr. Arduum invites you to answer the question, knowing you weren’t prepared for it. <br> <br>
										<strong> Do you... </strong>
									</p>
									<div class="small-text remove-underline">
										<a href="8.html"> Answer the question, knowing that the slightest mistake would cost you yet another beating</a> <br> <br>
										<a href="9.html">Stay silent, hoping someone would answer it for you (with that “someone” probably risking another beating for speaking out of line) </a>

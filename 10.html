										<strong>Place: </strong> Rome, Italy <br>
										<strong>Your Mission: </strong> Experience rhetoric and prepare to enter politics in three years  <br> <br>

                    At least school’s over now… you think, knowing that Mr. Arduum had been right: you were going into politics, and your attitude wasn’t going to do you any good.
                    As you roam the busy streets of Rome feeling bored at the bustling city and all its architecture, you think about your future career. <br>
                    “Tiberius! How’s it going, young man!” <br>
                    You turn around, grateful to see your rhetor Ignis Conscientia. Old and annoying at times as he might be, he was actually kind and understanding. <br>
                    “Ignis,” you say, putting your right hand up to your chest as a symbol of reverence. <br>
                    (Rhetors, like modern scholars, were highly respected figures in society.)<br>

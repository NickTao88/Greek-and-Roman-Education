                    “I thought so… disappointing. Now look here, boy. You might be the future emperor, for all I care. Yet, as of now, you are my student, and I am your teacher, Mr. Nero.
                    I have absolute authority over whatever happens in this class, and even if you run home scared telling your father what had happened today, he cannot do anything to me.” <br>

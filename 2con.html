                    “Class, today we will be studying Carpe Diem by Horace. (In reality, The Odes, which contained the poem Carpe Diem, was not published until 23 BCE, although its original author was indeed Horace.)
                    But today, we have a student who is late to class and he will get 5 strokes of the cane… Now which of you will volunteer caning this insolent brat?” <br>
                    You stand beside Mr. Arduum, looking sour, as he asks the class at large. (In Roman schools, beatings were not so organized as they are here.
                    Crowds of older boys would beat the younger ones at will, and there were definitely no “volunteering to cane somebody”, nor fellow students holding down the offenders to be beat when a student receives the cane!
                    Actually, it was two helpers, or slaves, who held the student down.) Thankfully, a friend of yours gets up, takes the cane from the back wall, and marches up to the front of the room. <br>
                    “I’m sorry, but this time, you’re taking one for the team,” he whispers, keeping his head down. <br>
                    You find yourself pinned on the floor by four other final year students. (Roman schools did not have desks at all. Students were seated in backless wooden chairs.) <br> <br>

									<p class= "small-text">
                    Just another typical school day, you think to yourself. Only if I could rest for the weekend… not that Mr. Severus Decretorius Arduum would care. (1. The name literally means “strict, decisive, difficult”. 2. In Imperial Rome, there was no weekend break for school. In fact,  at that time, students had to go to school seven days a week. Fortunately, there were a lot of religious festivals and market days when children did not have to go to school.) Mr. Arduum was a difficult teacher, and there was no way out of class. In school (which was basically a room at the back of some small shop or building and was operated independently from other schools by only one teacher), your ideas and inputs were never valued unless required. You were expected to be obedient; any failure was met with harsh beatings (and not to mention the ridicule from older students and peers). You drag your feet across the courtyard and curse Mr. Arduum under your breath as your
										slave sees to that you enter the classroom. (1. Nobles in Imperial Rome were escorted almost everywhere by helpers, or slaves. 2. Many students back then hated school.)
	                  You are knocked off balance momentarily as a hulking figure in a white tunic with red and purple stripes on either side dashes past you toward the classroom. (The stripes are a symbol of status, or rather just a symbol of officiality.) You realize that the figure is none other than Mr. Arduum. <br> <br>
 										<strong> Do you... </strong>

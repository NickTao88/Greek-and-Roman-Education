                    “Mr. Arduum, Carpe Diem was written by Horace and is the eleventh poem in Book I of The Odes. But tell me, sir, how did you come across the text when the book isn’t even published, as of now?”
                    you say, apparently glowing at your own brilliance for figuring this out. <br>
                    “Yes… Mr. Nero. Carpe Diem was indeed published by Horace, or at least he intends to do so along with the other of his Odes around seven years later.
                    And you are correct in saying that Carpe Diem is the eleventh poem in Book I. As to the source of the text, you need not know, but only that I have vast social networks. How do you think I do not know this proficient writer when I even know who your father is?” <br>
                    Mr. Arduum finishes with another snide remark. You fall silent for a moment.
                    As you try to open your mouth to argue again, Mr. Arduum speaks up, <br>
                    “You know, your father was right. He never expected you to be a outstanding politician. All along, that was your mother’s idea, was it not?” <br>
                    You ponder this remark made by this hateful teacher with a note of seriousness, yet at the same time feeling indignant for what he accused you of. <br>
                    “Mr. Arduum, what makes you think that I am incapable? I shall show you what it means to be a great politician, but not that you would live to see it!”
